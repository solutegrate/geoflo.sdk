## Code of Conduct
This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to <support@solutegrate.com>.

## I Have a Question
If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available Documentation. Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing Issues that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:
- Open an Issue.
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc.), depending on what seems relevant. We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

## I Want To Contribute

### Reporting Bugs
#### Before Submitting a Bug Report
A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information, and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible:
- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- You may want to include screenshots and animated GIFs that help demonstrate the steps or point out the part related to the suggestion. You can use tools like LICEcap (macOS and Windows) or Peek (Linux).
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most CONTRIBUTING.md users.
