## ‚ö° Deployment

Before you get started with GeoFlo, you need to have a Mapbox access token.
For more information on creating and using Mapbox access tokens:

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage/Examples

### CDN Import

```javascript
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://sdk.geoflo.pro/geoflo.css">

  <div id="map"></div>

  <script type="text/javascript" src="https://sdk.geoflo.pro/geoflo.min.js"></script>
```

### Initialization

```javascript
  (async function() {
      await geoflo.init('YOUR_MAPBOX_TOKEN', { container: 'map' });
      geoflo.map.on(geoflo.id, function onGeoFloEvent(event) { console.log(event); });
  })();
```

## üèÅ Credits

This is my first Github Project and first MapboxGL Plugin. While I have looked deeply into the MapboxGL code/docs, please understand that bugs will creep their way in.

This project utilizes the following libraries:

- **Mapbox GL JS**: A powerful mapping platform that provides geospatial services and tools.
- **Turf.js**: A modular geospatial engine written in JavaScript and TypeScript. Turf.js offers traditional spatial operations, helper functions for creating GeoJSON data, and data classification and statistics tools.

### About Mapbox GL JS

Mapbox GL JS is a client-side JavaScript library for building web maps and web applications with Mapbox's modern mapping technology. You can use Mapbox GL JS to:

- Display Mapbox maps in a web browser or client.
- Add user interactivity to your maps.
- Customize the map experience in your application.

The "GL" in Mapbox GL JS refers to Mapbox GL, a graphics library that renders 2D and 3D Mapbox maps as dynamic visual graphics with OpenGL in any compatible web browser, without using additional plugins.

### About Turf.js

Turf.js is a JavaScript library for spatial analysis. It includes:
- Traditional spatial operations
- Helper functions for creating GeoJSON data
- Data classification and statistics tools
